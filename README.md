# Shoppingcart
My shopping cart project takes a text file and produces a list that outputs three things.
A list all all produce and number of produce was sold that day.
A list of a specific item and how many times it was purchased in one day.
A histogram of all produce items purchased on a particular day.

This program makes use of a switch statement c++ and integrates python functions.
