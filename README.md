# Shoppingcart
My shopping cart project takes a text file and produces a list that outputs three things.
A list all all produce and number of produce was sold that day.
A list of a specific item and how many times it was purchased in one day.
A histogram of all produce items purchased on a particular day.

This program makes use of a switch statement c++ and integrates python functions.
I found that the functions are concise and to the point where anyone that can understand code would be able to pick up quickly what I'm doing.
I could enhance my code by add a few more validity checks with user input, I felt that the more code I put into the function the more prone this project was to break.
I found that utilizing the build in overloaded functions were a pain to write because I didn't have the flexibility to do what I thought needed to be done.
I added comments for maintanability.
